## Feature Backlog


### Version 2.3 — Enhance consumer visualization and cost analysis - sharpen tariffs handling

Year-1 product depth (trust / What-If / churn). **Good-enough €** for SE and demos — invoice-grade bill reconciliation is explicitly out of scope (nice-to-have later). Thin marker/data-model prep for SAM (`2.3.f`) is done; connector rewrite remains `2.4`. SE MILP speed/tuning (`2.3.c.0a`–`2.3.c.3`) → [Backlog-Erledigt.md](Backlog-Erledigt.md). CSV / Basislast / earnie_role alignment → [Backlog-Erledigt.md](Backlog-Erledigt.md).

- [ ] Pre release 2.3.0-alpha.3 for SCC

- [x] Add Energieflussmonitor Baustein and Zähler to my own Loxone Config to be able to test csv-data-export
  - Research (done) → [Backlog-Erledigt.md](Backlog-Erledigt.md); process blueprint plan `.cursor/plans/energieflussmonitor_hausprofil_blueprint_a.plan.md`; auto-sync deferred under **2.4** MCP


- [ ] **2.3.0 — Release**
  - Finalize after test usage; update German docs as needed (carry-over from 2.2.0 finalize)


### Version 2.4 — Become Loxone agnostic and standardize communication (SAM expansion)

- [ ] **2.4.a — Earnie ↔ smarthome internal interface**
  - **Goal:** Reach more smarthome “nerds” willing to build connections to their specific hardware
  - Redefine Loxone Markers → Smarthome Markers suitable for multiple standards (e.g. MQTT or Matter)
  - Create architecture for a connector approach that bridges a common generic internal Earnie interface to specific smarthome interfaces
  - Create specification for other smarthome connectors to the internal Earnie interface
- [ ] **2.4.b — Loxone connector extraction**
  - Refactor existing Loxone HTTP communication to a Loxone↔Earnie connector behind the internal interface
- [ ] **2.4.c — Device interface schemas & libraries**
  - Enhance JSON schemas to standardized interfaces between devices (heat pump, battery, EV, consumers, …) as templates for a library of communication interfaces between smarthome system and Earnie
  - Build a Loxone library as counterpart to those templates for quick interface configuration
  - Prepare similar templates for other standards (see above)
- [ ] Integrate a MCP-based automatic communication-definition (see also `Earnie-Projekt/Entwicklungsplan/Entwicklungs-Plan-Earnie-cons.md` §3.1; dedicated `MCP-Interfacing-für-Earnie.md` not present) in Loxone-Kommunikation page
  - [ ] **Research / follow-up:** Auto-sync Energieflussmonitor meter tree → Hausprofil consumers + CSV paths (interpretation C). Blocked today by no official Loxone structure export; revisit with MCP structure-scan / connector work. Manual process blueprint: `.cursor/plans/energieflussmonitor_hausprofil_blueprint_a.plan.md`

- [ ] **2.4.d — Donate**
  - Add a Donate feature into sidebar
- [ ] **2.4.0 — Release**
  - First non-Loxone pilot only when a volunteer connector exists; update docs / CONTRIBUTING for connector authors


### Version 2.+1 — Improve "security" against violating License agreements

- [ ] Clarify how user could get a one-time registry that is bound to their hardware
  - What are the technical prerequisites to make that running?
- [ ] **Banner der Wahrheit — Layer C (deferred):** signed official builds / GHCR attestation + startup verifier; tie to hardware registry. Enforces attribution on *official* distribution only — not source forks. See plan outline (A + light B shipped in 2.2.0).


### Version 2.+1 — Introducing nested data models

- [ ] Enhance data model to nested structures. E.g. pool can consist of multiple "inner" consumers or house consists also of multiple "inner" consumers
  - Move Loxone markers to data model - remove flat definition in config.json where possible
  - **Note:** Thin marker↔role prep and UI editability are in **2.3.f**; full connector extraction in **2.4**. This chapter owns nesting / structure, not the SAM interface rewrite.
- [ ] **Recommendation mode smart/adaptive devices** (follow-up to recommendation mode manual devices)
  - Adaptive re runtime/energy per run; smart devices instead of manual input
  - Adaptation algo maintains `appliance_recommendation.default_power_kw` from Loxone power markers (`loxone_inputs.power_name`) on house-profile generics — reserved so far, no live use
  - Use Loxone power markers also for Sankey-Diagram for further differentation of defined consumers


### Version 2.+1 — Epics **Adaptation** & **Thermals** (architecture first)

- [ ] **Adaptation P1** — Generic adaptation model (skeleton)
  - Common structure for parameter adaptation of various forecast models:
    - Reference value (target for adaptation)
    - Variable parameters (with bounds)
    - Time horizon (e.g. 24 h for PV/freezer, 1 year for swim spa/house)
    - Start parameters from `config.json`; adaptation history **separate**; correct live parameters only when needed (rhythm oriented to horizon)
  - Target models (connect later): PV yield, thermal models, solar collector
  - **Precursor (done):** *Unified Open-Meteo solar* — shared archive bundle ([Backlog-Erledigt.md](Backlog-Erledigt.md))
- [ ] **Adaptation P2** — PV adaptation (new approach) — first pilot on Adaptation P1
  - Sidebar PV tuning removed (UI S-2 P1 + 2026-07-15 code path) → [Backlog-Erledigt.md](Backlog-Erledigt.md) § PV tuning removal; see `runtime/pv_accuracy_log.csv`
  - Replace or integrate old `pv_tuner` path into Adaptation P1 (`pv_tuner.py` counter delta only)
- [ ] **Adaptation P3** — Adaptation algorithm (PV pilot)
  - Concrete update loop on Adaptation P2; thermal models remain **linear** (thermal adaptation only in Thermals P3)
- [ ] **Thermals P2** — Coupled single-node models
  - House ↔ heat storage ↔ solar system
  - House parameters from energy certificate (`EXAMPLE:/local/reference/energy-certificate.pdf` — not in repo)
  - Prepare air conditioning as thermal consumer
- [ ] **Thermals P3** — Thermal parameter adaptation (on Adaptation P1)
  - `heat_loss_kw_per_k` and further linear model parameters; horizon per consumer (24 h / 1 year)
- [ ] **Adaptation P4** — UI visualization adaptation algos (after Adaptation P3 and Thermals P3)


### Version 2.+1

- [ ] Generic EV model — for better reusability


### Version 2.+1

- [ ] Better consumption optimization with temperature-control devices
  - [ ] Heat pump (Prio3) — only indirect control via setpoint adjustment via Loxone setpoint (after **Thermals P2**); distinct from **Thermals P1a** (direct enable/PWM flex from daily HDD budget)

### Version 3.0
- [ ] Make complete Earnie available as cloud service (Online optimization and Internet communication with local smarthome / isolated devices) - similar to "Smart-Energy" (Steiermark)
